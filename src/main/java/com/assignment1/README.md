#Donkey Kong
Donkey Kong is a classic arcade game where the player controls Mario as he tries to rescue Princess Peach from the clutches of the titular Donkey Kong. The player must navigate through obstacles such as barrels and fireballs while climbing ladders to reach the top of the level where Donkey Kong is holding Peach captive.

This repository contains a Java implementation of the classic Donkey Kong game. The game is developed using Object-Oriented Programming concepts and follows a Model-View-Controller architecture. The game features include:

Mario as the main character that can move left, right, up and down
Donkey Kong as the main antagonist that throws barrels and fireballs
PowerUps that Mario can collect to gain extra abilities
Score and Lives
